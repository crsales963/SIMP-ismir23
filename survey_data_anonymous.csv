1,Careless Love,1,48,6,4,attention to detail,5,"Good feel for the piece. Love the use of pedal. Nice rubato at the end.  If anything, tempo is a bit fast.",4,"good accuracy, could have more dynamic shaping",4,Very good. The cresc. to F and dim. to mp wasn't there.,1,5,"The tempo stayed consistent, and all of the notes were played correctly. They also followed the cut time tempo. They held out the notes for the correct length, and the song flowed really well. In addition, they followed the ritardando at the end and slowed down.",2,5,"I didn't sense anything wrong with this piece. It flowed very well, had great tempo and dynamics. The pianist sounded confident in what they were playing.",6,5,"High level of musicality, no mistakes, great use of pedal.",9,5,"The flow is very smooth, along with very good tone . The notes and tempo are perfect.",13,3,"A bit too fast, and does not portray the emotions of the piece well. But, the best out of quality and skill.",20,5,This performance is smoothly done without any mistakes in the note and the player used pedal to make the piece sounds connected.
1,Careless Love,2,48,16,4,note error,4,Good tempo. Nice steady rhythm. Missed a B-flat right hand.,2,"under tempo, lumpy heavy performance; no balance or shaping",2,"Balance to heavy to LH. LH chords detached. Too slow, no ""flow."" Wrong note ms. 5 RH.",1,3,"Although the tempo stayed consistent, the notes were not held for the correct amount of time. Specifically, the notes in the left hand were too short, which made them sound too choppy. Overall, the song dragged too much and didn't sound cohesive.",2,2,This piece felt choppy and not cohesive. The pianist sounded confident in what they were playing but that confidence did not lend to ease of listening.,6,3,"Few mistakes, but not very musical.",9,2,There's some wrong notes in the beginning and some half notes don't last long enough.,13,4,Well played in skill and also emotions. The right tempo and enunciation of specific notes.,20,4,One obvious note mistake but relatively a stable flow.
1,Careless Love,3,44,13,3,note errors,4,Good tempo! Good reading of chords (missed the b-flat minor chord).,1,"way too slow, no balance, no dynamic contrast.  Not musical.  Wrong notes",1,No LH/RH balance. Wrong notes line 3. Too slow. Heavy sound.,1,3,"The tempo was too slow and didn't follow the cut time notation. In addition, it sounded too hesitant, and the song didn't flow very well. It was too choppy.",2,1,This piece also felt choppy and not cohesive. The dynamics written on the sheet music were not followed. There were also a few times where notes were played that were not written on the sheet music.,6,2,"Left hand too strong, melody too weak. Very detached.",9,3,"The flow isn't very smooth, otherwise it has accurate notes and tempo.",13,3,"Skill is lacking compared to other two, and a bit slower than necessary. However, the heart and emotion is very well presented.",20,3,3 obvious note mistakes.
1,Careless Love,4,48,2,4,note and timing errors,4,"Good job reading! Nice rhythm throughout.   Correct the b-flat minor chord, add dynamics, rit at the end, and you are good to go!",2,"tempo not quite consistent, some inaccuracies",3,Good balance. Wrong notes line 3 and hesitations.,3,3,"The performer hesitated while playing, but hit all the notes just fine. All they needed was confidence!",5,3,"Some parts feel a bit out of tempo. It sounds a bit emotionless, but not too bad.",12,4,The player seems to do very well with note accuracy. There was some hesitancy in the tempo at the beginning that improved throughout the recording. The ending had a very nice tone on the final chord.,14,3,"The notes were accurate as far as I could tell, but the beat was inconsistent - there were many pauses. Additionally, there was no change in sound intensity (like at the crescendo).",18,2,"Performer was too tentative in playing, and the tempo was off.  He or she also missed some notes.",21,3,"This person seemed to not hold notes for their full length in the left hand, and also got tripped up towards the end. Also didn't fully consider dynamics and other markings like the ritardando."
1,Careless Love,5,48,19,3,More carefully follows the specific directions for dynamics and tempo,5,Nice tempo! Nice steady rhythm! Accurate reading! Good little rubato at the end!,4,good smooth performance with addition of pedal; needed to rit at end; could use more dynamic shaping,4,Good use of pedal. All good except rit at end and dynamics as indicated lines 3-4 not enough.,3,5,The performer played the piece smoothly and with confidence! It sounded effectively flawless.,5,5,"Way more flow and smoothness. Dynamics make sense and are more interesting to listen to. I don't want to give it a 4 because of that, but in my opinion, could be a tiny bit slower as the tempo is ""moderately slow""",12,5,The player had a very consistent tempo. There was great phrasing between sections of the music. The overall musicality was excellent.,14,4,"The notes were accurate, and the pace was consistent. However, there was no change in sound intensity at the crescendo.",18,5,"Great, consistent playing, and excellent tempo.  He or she played with confidence.",21,5,Sounded very good overall. Minor details in dynamics were missing but overall it sounded like a worked on piece.
1,Careless Love,6,48,15,4,Error in m.12. Too fast. Little or no dynamic or tempo change. LH chords too short,4,Good reading overall. Tempo a bit fast. Also missed left hand b-flat minor chords. Nice steady tempo! Very good!,2,Left hand is too detached; should be smoother.  One mistake,3,LH too detached. Good tempo. No rit. at end. No dynamics as indicated lines 3-4. Wrong LH note LH line 3.,3,4,"This performer went quite quickly through the piece. Though they hit all of the notes, they sounded very legato, which might not have been the most effective presentation for this piece.",5,3,"A bit too fast. Dynamics somewhat okay. Main issue is the fact that the melody notes sounded almost staccato. No legato markings were respected, and the melody notes ended up to separate (felt like cuts between every note). This was opposite of what was written in the sheet, and opposite of what sounds appealing.",12,3,This recording has a faster tempo than the others that I have listened to so far. The notes seem to be quite accurate but the chords are a bit abrupt.,14,3,"The notes were accurate, and the pace was consistent. However, it was played at a pretty rapid pace, there was no change in sound intensity, and the half notes were not held for long enough.",18,3,"Played the notes correctly, but in a mechanical, choppy way that was not pleasing.",21,4,"The person clearly knew the music, but was not ever holding out the left hand notes which leaves it sounding bouncy rather than connected."
1,Careless Love,7,48,8,3,Error in m.10. Over-pedaling. No dynamic or tempo changes,5,"Very good. Pedal use is good, but make sure you clean pedal for left hand quarter notes. Good rhythm.",2,a little blurry pedal and a couple mistakes.  Not much shaping.,3,"Some pedal blur. Wrong note line 3. No rit., dynamic cresc/dim.",3,5,"There was only one brief moment of hesitation in the performance, and thus I still believe this smooth performance deserves an Excellent rating.",5,4,"A bit mushy, maybe too much right pedal. Very slow, could be a tiny bit faster. Some parts feel 'insecure' (like the player was caught a bit off guard with what's coming next).",12,3,This recording is very smooth and the notes are accurate. The chords have a very good tone. The volume is a bit low and makes the piece seem to have less emotion.,14,3,"This was good, but there was no change in sound intensity and I believe one of the notes was wrong.",18,4,"Nice, confident playing, but person missed a few notes.",21,4,A few wrong notes but overall good.
1,Careless Love,8,48,20,4,"RIght hand should be louder, Left hand softer.  No dynamic of tempo change- BUT notes are accurate .",5,Excellent! I like th tempo! Steady rhythm. Good solid chords.,2,Left hand a bit too heavy and detached.  Not enough melodic shaping.  accuracy good,3,"No rit, dynamics lines 3-4, heavy LH, no ""phrasing.""",8,2,Lack of musicality - clunky pedal work and nonfluid transitions between left hand chords.,11,4,"This recording makes no mistakes about the tempo and notes, but lacks of slight things like the break in measure 4.",15,3,"Accurate notes and rhythm, but the pianist did not do dynamic changes indicated on the score. Also the left hand is playing too loudly than the right hand (the melody).",16,3,"This has correct rhythm and the notes were correct, so it was true to the sheet music. It was played correctly, but it felt a bit rushed, which is why I didn't give it a 5, because the tempo marking said moderately slow. I also thought the phrasing was good and natural, in line with the sheet music. But it didn't incorporate any dynamics or the rit marking or tempo marking.",19,4,"Performer played the correct notes and maintained a set rhythm. The speed was a little fast, left hand was too loud, and the right hand could have been more legato.",,,
1,Careless Love,9,44,21,3,Error in RH m.11.  Nice dynamic contrast. Good Ritard at end,5,Excellent! Love the tempo and the subtle rise and fall. Careful to place the quarter notes correctly in m. 12.,3,under tempo and not enough dynamic shaping  But was steady.  One rhythm mistake.,4,Bit slow (should be in 2). Wrong rhythm end of line 3.,8,2,Too much pedal and inconsistent tempo.,11,3,"This recording is mostly accurate, but contains a mistake about the tempo at very last of the piece.",15,4,I like the tempo of this recording. The musical interpretation is good through the change of dynamics and the ritardando at the end. It could be better in melodic phrasing.,16,4,"I think this one was nice to listen to because they interpreted dynamics in a way that the first piece didn't and the tempo felt right (the marking in the sheet music said moderately slow).  In the last measure of the third line, the last two quarter notes were rushed and played as eighth notes and were played after the second half note in the bass clef, which is not what was written. They did the rit at the end, which did a good job of phrasing the ending naturally.",19,3,"Performance was played with correct notes but the timing was off on the fourth line, last measure.",,,
1,Careless Love,10,48,1,2,"LH much too loud, Note errors due to ignoring Key signature. No dynamic or tempo changes",4,"Overall playing is good. Very good tempo and rhythm. Need to rework right hand. Piece is in F Major, hence B-flat in right hand.",1,Left hand way too loud; mistakes; very heavy,1,LH too loud. Too slow and heavy. No flow. Two wrong notes in RH. No dynamic changes and rit at end.,8,3,"Seems more technically sound and more confidently played (less hesitation, more fluid transition) then the above two.",11,2,This recording misses the Bb through the whole piece.,15,2,A wrong note is played (B flat). The player kept the tempo steady but not dynamics and expression.,16,1,"This recording forgot the b flat in the key signature that occurs in the beginning of each phrase right before the C. That is an important part of the piece and it happens repeatedly, which changes the nature of the piece (moving it to major and taking it out of minor). Also, there was no use of dynamic variation or phrasing or any artistic change in tempo (which can be done while staying true to the sheet music).",19,3,"Performer maintained tempo but missed the b flat twice in the right hand. Left hand was choppy, and right hand could have been more lyrical.",,,
1,Careless Love,11,48,9,4,Note error m.12 . More dynamics needed,4,Nice playing. Be careful to not speed up at the end. And correct B-flat minor chord left hand.   Love that the left hand is quieter than the right hand. Very good!,4,pretty good; Left Hand a bit choppy.  Good right hand projection   Needed to do rit at end.,4,Wrong LH end line 3. Tempo fine. LH a bit heavy at end of phrases.,8,4,"Much more confidence, and the higher tempo certainly contributes to it feeling less clunky. Some minor points - no ritardando at the end - but this was the only one I wouldn't have minded listening to more of.",11,3,"This recording fails to miss notes, but is not accurate about the tempo.",15,2,The tempo is not very steady. The notes are correct. No musical interpretations.,16,4,"This was good but the phrasing was off - there was never a ""breath"" after the phrases (which would require the pianist to like lift all her fingers off of the keys), so it was hard to know when one phrase began and ended. This person did observe the rit at the end and played the correct tempo and the correct notes.",19,5,Performance held a nice tempo. The right hand was lyrical and the left hand maintained the beat with a nice softness.,,,
2,Cielito Lindo,1,48,2,2,"Rhythm errors throughout, plus pauses in tempo. Pitches generally correct",2,Very good left hand chords but rhythm is incorrect throughout.,1,hesitations and wrong rhythm throughout.  Wrong notes.  Poor,1,Rhythms completely wrong. Bad balance and dynamics. Wrong notes.,1,2,"Even though the notes were correct, a lot of the rhythms were incorrect. They didn't maintain a steady tempo and didn't follow notations like staccato.",2,2,"It took the pianist about 8 measures to establish a steady rhythm. There were also a few note errors, where notes were not played where they should have been.",6,3,"Tempo was not constant. Melody was played nicely, accompaniment could use some work.",9,1,Right hand nots are not even (wrong length of the notes) along with a lot of wrong notes.,13,3,"Just average, nothing too special but executed with good skill.",20,2,several note mistakes. did not play the staccatos in the first couple of measures. tempo is not stable.
2,Cielito Lindo,2,48,16,4,"Note error in LH m.9. LH should be more staccato. Generally correct, though.",5,"Excellent! Nice contrast between right hand and left hand. If anything, left hand can be shorter throughout.",3,Rhythm good. Tempo good. Wrong note in Left hand.,3,LH not staccato. Wrong note.,1,4,"The notes and rhythms were all correct. However, they didn't follow the notation for staccato, so the left hand was played incorrectly. However, overall, it was very fluid and confident.",2,5,The rhythm was impeccably steady throughout and all notes were played perfectly.,6,4,"Mistake-free playing, high musicality. Melody could be clearer.",9,4,Very good tempo and melody line except the some of the staccatos are too long,13,4,Great skill but lacks heart and seems like they are going through the motions.,20,3,did not handle the staccatos well for the whole piece. one note mistake.
2,Cielito Lindo,3,48,19,4,Generally very accurate. RH should be much more legato,5,Accurate reading! Very good! Be sure right hand plays legato throughout.,3,"Sometimes did not hold ties in right hand.  Okay performance, a bit heavy in the left hand.",3,RH ties not held and some rests added.. Too slow. Inconsistent LH stacc.,1,4,"The notes and rhythms were all played correctly, but the song dragged a bit. In addition, they didn't follow the staccato notation in the left hand, so that was technically incorrect.",2,4,"The piece was played accurately to the sheet music, but did not have the same liveliness in sound as Cielito Lindo 02. It also could have been played better using the legatos marked on the music.",6,4,"Nice playing. Was a little slow and could have better phrasing, but overall very good and consistent.",9,5,Sounds very good.,13,4,Skill is on par with #1 but has the best rhythm and heart and therefore it is evident they understand the music.,20,4,did not handle the staccatos well for the first and last couple of measures.
2,Cielito Lindo,4,48,9,4,Very accurate but a tiny mistake on RH end of line 2,4,Very good! Need to differentiate staccato left hand quarter notes vs. eighth notes. Rhythm is excellent! Good tempo!,4,good performance; right hand had a little flub.  Could use more melodic shaping.  Nice tempo,3,RH articulation not observed (added staccato). Mistake RH line 3. Tempo slow. F/mf dynamics not clear.,3,4,"This flowed pretty well! A note or rhythm here or there was missed, but it wasn't too noticeable.",5,3,"At least one very obvious mistake in the playing (right hand melody second line). A bit boring, emotionless. Dynamics felt very flat.",12,2,"The accuracy of the notes is a bit inconsistent. The player conveys an upbeat tempo and mood well. It seems the bass clef chords may not be very in tune, but the player pushed past this and continued well.",14,4,"This was excellent except for the one measure where the a note was a little off, and one chord was completely skipped.",18,4,"Person played with confidence and spirit and with a good tempo, but missed a few notes.",21,3,"Seemed as if this person got lost within the music some times, playing wrong rhythms and playing without confidence."
2,Cielito Lindo,5,44,21,4,"RH errors in Mm. 8 and 10, but accurate otherwise",4,Student has a good grasp of harmony. Able to make the piece sound correct with his/her own additions.   Need to read score more carefully.  Be sure left hand is consistent throughout with the length of the staccatos.,2,occasional heaviness in the left hand.  A few wrong notes and rhythms.  Tempo is good.,3,Inconsistent LH staccato. Wrong rhythms and notes in middle.,3,5,"Like the above track, this performance had a missed note or two, but they instead embraced the missed part and continued forward as though it were correct. As such, I think it was quite a good job!",5,2,"Did not respect all the staccato chords in the left hand. Felt very forced. Did not respect the ""lively"" suggestion by the composer. Bland.",12,4,"The player seemed to lack confidence in the chords at the beginning, but quickly improved. There is good balance and tonality.",14,3,"There were many pauses that were incorrect in length -- either too long or too short. Also, the staccato notes were inconsistent: some were longer in length than others.",18,3,"Nice, confident playing mostly, but occasionally just sounded like banging on the keyboard, and the person missed some notes.",21,2,"This person made the piece sound good, but wasn't fully reading the notes on the page, adding in and taking away notes. Also did not have a staccato left hand on the second beat of the measure, likely because they were searching for notes."
2,Cielito Lindo,6,48,11,5,Almost perfect,4,"Good steady tempo throughout. Work on right hand legato. Love the consistent touch of left hand.   Last 3-4 measures of chorus need reworking. Other than that, nice solid playing!",2,under tempo; right hand needs to be smoother with phrase shaping.  Left hand mistakes,2,Too slow (not lively). Some articulation breaks of legato in RH. Tie added line 3; wrong notes line 4.,8,4,"Mistakes in right hand measures 11 and 13, but otherwise very solid. Good left hand staccatos overall, though some were missed and others could have been snappier. Good understanding of slurs vs non slurs, but not a lot of thought given to the flow of the song.",11,4,"This recording is mostly accurate, but misses a note in the second last line. However, it makes great musical shape in a whole.",15,4,Steady tempo and correct notes are played. The player did a good job in playing the staccato notes on the left hand.,16,4,"The third measure of the chorus was wrong (forgot the second D in the treble clef), but this was good otherwise and capture the essence of the piece well (lively, upbeat, and got the staccato markings and phrasing right). It also observed the tied notes and played at a nice tempo.",19,4,"Performance was very nice. The performer maintained a steady tempo with a staccato left hand under a legato right. There was a missed note on the third line, third measure.",,,

Just need to practice playing four eighth notes smoothly.,1,under tempo and unsteady beat.  lots of hesitation in right hand,3,Multiple rhythm hesitations in 8th note measures. Otherwise good.,1,1,"A lot of the rhythms were incorrect, and so the song was played wrong. In addition, it sounded really hesitant, and so the tempo did not stay consistent because they had to pause to figure out what to play next.",2,1,"There was a very noticeable note mistake in the middle of the piece and multiple pauses where the pianist was clearly trying to find the correct note to play. Because of this, the rhythm was not steady either.",6,2,"Had some counting issues.
